# This repo contains my study notes for YDKJS series. 

*This is by no means a perfessional's take on these books, only for personal usage.If you are interested, fork it but please always use the [original books](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) as a guide line.*

* There is a summary for each of 6 books. You can fork it if you want, I tried to summarize all the the important stuff from these books. And I listed everything out in bullet point for easy navigation as well as better understanding. 
* Again, if you are a beginner, consult all the books 1st, compare and contrust. 
* If anyone finds any sort of errors or misktakes I made in those summary, submit an issue.
* For anyone who wants to learn JS/YDKJS together, PM me on twitter @zh0ux1ang. We can share about almost everything about learning through these books. The issues we are facing, challenges we need to take. Or understandings about js. Anything. 
* This is an ongoing process as I haven't finished all the books. As my notes starting to complete, I will consult the author himself whether I can put out my notes on github without violation of his copyrights. 
* If one day the author requires me to take down these notes, I will do so immediately.
